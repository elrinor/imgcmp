ImgCmp is a tool that helps you manage large collections of images (e.g. wallpapers, scans, photos...). ImgCmp detects _similar_ (not _equal_) images, thus allowing to eliminate redundant copies of the same image in multiple resolutions or formats.

Main features of ImgCmp are:
  * Support for BMP, GIF and JPG image formats.
  * Automatic assignment of ratings to similar images so that you can save only the better ones.
  * Maintenance of a database of processed files so that once you want to update your image collection you won't need to rescan it.

ImgCmp currently cannot properly handle line drawings (e.g. manga scans) as they are all pretty similar.
